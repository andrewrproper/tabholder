## Features

See the index.html page

## Design

This is done using a very simple standalone local web page.

The page is meant to be very light on resource usage. Therefore,
it has no dependencies, and has a very simple look and feel.

## Deployment

Push the `main` branch to github, and it will automatically deploy
via GitHub Pages.
